      "founderName": "Hazrat Maulana Syed Siddiqui Ahmad Sahab.",
      "madrasaHistory": "Madrasa Arabia Tajweedul Quran is located in Masauni, Post Office Kalinjar, Tehsil Naraini, District Banda (UP). Surrounded by hills and a renowned heritage site (Kalinjar Fort), this area of Masauni was considered backward in terms of religion, education, and morality. The great Islamic scholar, Hazrat Allama, Faqih-e-Millat, Hazrat Maulana Syed Qari Siddiq Ahmad Sahab Bandwi (Rahmatullah Alaih), along with Mufti Mahmoodul Hasan Sahab Deobandi (Rahmatullah Alaih), and their disciple and the founder of this madrasa, Hazrat Maulana Syed Siddiq Ahmad Masauni (Rahmatullah Alaih), laid the foundation of this madrasa in 1984 (1404 Hijri).",
      "founderDedication": "Hazrat Maulana Syed Siddiq Ahmad Masauni (Rahmatullah Alaih) had a deep devotion to Islam and a fervent desire to revive the Sunnah. He started this madrasa in the courtyard of his own home to provide a sacred space where Muslim children could learn to recite the Holy Quran with proper **Tajweed** (pronunciation rules). With the support of local people and the generosity of sincere Muslims, this holy institution came into existence. After him, the responsibility of running the madrasa was entrusted to the current principal, **Hazrat Maulana Syed Abdul Tawwab Sahab**. Since then, under the supervision of virtuous and sincere individuals, the madrasa has been continuously progressing. By the grace of Allah, it is a remarkable example of religious and educational progress for the region and surrounding areas.",
      "currentStatus": "The madrasa is engaged in its noble mission with sincerity and determination. Currently, it has **26 teachers** and approximately **515 students**, along with **13 branches** in the surrounding areas, whose expenses are also managed by the madrasa. In addition to religious education, provisions are made for modern and academic studies. The madrasa's expenses are entirely dependent on the generosity of Muslims, as it has no permanent source of income.",
      "educationDetails": "Currently, around 515 students are studying here. Every year, approximately 80-100 students complete Nazra Quran (recitation with Tajweed). Additionally, the madrasa offers **Hifz** and **Aalimiyat** departments. All these courses are maintained through the curriculum of **Darul Uloom Nadwa, Lucknow**. The madrasa also has several departments and courses that help students shine like diamonds in the future. These children then become a source of joy for their parents and a means of continuous reward for the madrasa's founders.",
      "girlsSectionTitle": "Jamia Fatima Zahra Lilbanat (Girls' Section)",
      "girlsSectionText": "Madrasa Arabia Tajweedul Quran also runs an Islamic institution for girls, currently operating in a small house with a total of 90 female students, all from the local area. People from surrounding areas and various cities wish to send their daughters to this institution for girls, but due to the lack of residential and hostel facilities, we are unable to cover their expenses or provide them with proper comfort. However, the educational facilities are excellent and as good or better than those provided for boys. By the grace of Allah and through your prayers, land for the madrasa has already been acquired. Now, only the construction of the building and other necessary tasks remain, for which we need your good wishes and participation in this project.",

      "founderMessageText2": "In 1984, I was deeply saddened to see the trend of Muslims in my village and surrounding areas converting to other religions, with some already having left Islam. I realized this was due to the absence of a madrasa providing Islamic education.",
      "founderMessageText3": "For me, education was never limited to mere literacy; it was a means of character building, nurturing the soul, and preparing future generations to walk the path shown by Allah ﷻ and His beloved Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Inspired by the Prophet’s saying, 'Seeking knowledge is obligatory upon every Muslim (male and female),' I established this institution where children learn Islamic values such as honesty, compassion, humility, and respect.",
      "founderMessageText4": "Initially, I dedicated my spare time to teaching students. By the grace of Allah, generous individuals donated land, and construction began. We started with a few rooms with mud walls and tiled roofs, and students from outside started residing there. Over time, with the help of students, construction continued despite significant challenges.",
